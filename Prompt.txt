--> Initial Prompt ( GPT 4o ):

    - I am building an AI application with modern tech stack. It is part of the GIthub Co-Pilot One Day challenge where we are required to create new innovative solution that will be helpful for real life using co-pilot. I have project description that goes as follows:
    Being a developer it's important we contribute towards the betterment of the society though usefull application. So, I have decided to built an application that will allow people to report crime and incidents anonymously keeping their identity safe. The application will have Submit Report, Track Report and an admin dashboard(Authentication Required). The user can submit image of the report based on its gravity, Emergency or non Emergency situation. Once submitted we can leverage gemini API to extract information regarding it and finally submit the report for tracking.

    Provide complete structure and flow of this application. Also in the end give this project a justifiable name.

    - Suggested Name: AnonGuard (Changed to Anonymous Guard)

--> A little bit of fun with description descrepency with me and co-pilot

    Provide better description

    Make it short and catchy

    Its good but sound simple. We are talking about crime here.

    Nah, it doesn't provide terror. Something like "Law Enforcement Crimes Reporting", better than you lol.


-->  TBH copilot messed up my layout.tsx (RIP). It did provide some code but most of it was not relevant, like in rootlayout it didn't even include the html tag, gradient class was in the wrong div and other things. This is the case of of 1:11PM IST 1/19/2025. I hope it gets better as we move furthur into the application.

--> A little bit change of mind. I was working with Navbar and had a basic setup with basic design. Decided to gave "Improve the styling of navbar.tsx component. Make it better at responsiveness at different screen size. Also include some animation effects." prompt to copilot and it went crazy. I mean it did a pretty decent job for a navbar. Hope paid off :) . 4:56PM 1/19/2025. Time to deploy the complete navbar.

--> Time: 6:47PM IST 1/19/2025. Copilot is doing pretty amazing job as of now. Had a blueprint for home page and used the same text as navbar to style and animate it(Some of it even I don't understant :)). 

--> Created Basic infrastructure for Report Page, Report Wizard, Report Form with prompt: "Now that we have successfully created our landing page let's move on to submit-report endpoint. It must include two choice Emergency and Non_Emergency. Based on these two choices enable the css for respective choice. Create a simple form with file input that can help user submit the incident details(Add Neccessary information regarding the incident to include in the form)." : As of 8:10PM IST 1/19/2025

--> So in ReportForm.tsx I had an issue with getting location. Initially I thought to go with MapBax but its somehow not accepting my payment. So I went with trust on copilot and provided this prompt: "In this report form.tsx I was trying to implement Location functionality using mapbox. But since it's paid service I was not able to use it. Analyze this component and enable location functionality accordingly without breaking any code. ReportForm is one of the part of other 2 component so make sure location functionality doesn't break the code.". And guess what, it worked like a charm. :)
